# React_App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This is all about React applications i.e. using simply React, using React with Redux and using features of hooks with React.

The project encapsulates three pages. They are as:

### React_Basics

Demonstrates Todo App where we can add our day-to-day activities and delete them from our list once done.

### React_Redux

Demonstrates a list of posts which could be viewed with its details and could be deleted from the lists of posts.

### React_Hooks

Demonstrates Songs App to add new songs to our playlists using the concept of Hooks.
