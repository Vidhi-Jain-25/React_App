# React_App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This is all about React applications i.e. using simply React, using React with Redux and using features of hooks with React.

The project encapsulates three pages. They are as:

### React_Basics

Demonstrates Todo App, where it:

-- Displays all the todo's.

-- Allows adding new todo i.e. our day-to-day activities to our todo lists.

-- Allows deleting todo from the lists, once completed.

### React_Redux

Demonstrates a list of posts, where it:

-- Displays various posts.

-- Allows to view the details of the post.

-- Allows to Delete post.

### React_Hooks

Demonstrates Songs App, where it:

-- Displays the playlists.

-- Add new songs to our playlists.

-- Keep track of count of songs by increasing the count by one each time we add a new song.
